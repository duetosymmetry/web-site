I am honored to have been selected as one of this year's Sloan
Research Fellows!  The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation awards these
fellowship annually (since 1955) through a highly competitive
application process.  [This year, 126 early-career researchers were
named Sloan Fellows](https://sloan.org/fellowships/2023-Fellows).  You
can see in Sloan's [fellows
database](https://sloan.org/fellows-database) the good company I'm in
(including undergrad friend [Todd
Gingrich](https://chemistry.northwestern.edu/people/core-faculty/profiles/todd-gingrich.html),
and grad school friend [Robyn
Sanderson](https://live-sas-physics.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/people/standing-faculty/robyn-sanderson)).
The Foundation writes (emphasis mine):
> [T]he Sloan Research Fellowships are one of the most competitive and
> prestigious awards available to early-career researchers. They are
> also often seen as a marker of the quality of an institution’s
> science faculty and proof of an institution’s success in attracting
> the most promising junior researchers to its ranks. **This year
> marks the first time a faculty member from University of Mississippi
> has received a Sloan Research Fellowship**—we want to extend our
> congratulations and hope you’re as excited as we are!

Thanks to the Sloan Foundation, my nominator, those who wrote letters
of support, and to all my colleagues who supported me over the years!
