> We perform a new test of general relativity (GR) with signals from
> GWTC-2, the LIGO and Virgo catalog of gravitational wave
> detections. We search for the presence of amplitude birefringence,
> in which left versus right circularly polarized modes of
> gravitational waves are exponentially enhanced and suppressed during
> propagation. Such an effect is present in various beyond-GR theories
> but is absent in GR. We constrain the amount of amplitude
> birefringence consistent with the data through an opacity parameter
> $$\kappa$$, which we bound to be $$\kappa \lesssim 0.74
> \textrm{Gpc}^{-1}$$. Our constraint is derived under an assumption
> that all GWTC-2 events have a common distance. This result for
> $$\kappa$$ is statistically significant, with a Jensen-Shannon
> divergence of $$7\times 10^{-2}$$ bits compared to an uninformative
> distribution on $$\kappa$$.  We then use these theory-agnostic
> results to constrain Chern-Simons gravity, a beyond-GR theory with
> motivations in quantum gravity. We bound the canonical Chern-Simons
> lengthscale to be $$\ell_0 \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^3$$, in agreement
> with other long-distance measurement results.
