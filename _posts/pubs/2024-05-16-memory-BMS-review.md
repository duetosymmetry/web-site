> Gravitational memory effects and the BMS freedoms exhibited at
> future null infinity have recently been resolved and utilized in
> numerical relativity simulations. With this, gravitational wave
> models and our understanding of the fundamental nature of general
> relativity have been vastly improved. In this paper, we review the
> history and intuition behind memory effects and BMS symmetries, how
> they manifest in gravitational waves, and how controlling the
> infinite number of BMS freedoms of numerical relativity simulations
> can crucially improve the waveform models that are used by
> gravitational wave detectors. We reiterate the fact that, with
> memory effects and BMS symmetries, not only can these
> next-generation numerical waveforms be used to observe
> never-before-seen physics, but they can also be used to test GR and
> learn new astrophysical information about our universe.
