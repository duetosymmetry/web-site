> The inspiral of a circular, non-precessing binary exhibits an
> approximate helical symmetry. The effects of eccentricity,
> precession, and radiation reaction break the exact symmetry. We
> estimate the failure of this symmetry using the flux of the BMS
> charge corresponding to helical symmetry carried away by
> gravitational waves. We analytically compute the helical flux for
> binaries moving on eccentric orbits and quasi-circular orbits
> without precession using post-Newtonian theory. The helical flux is
> non-vanishing at the 0PN order for eccentric orbits as expected. We
> analytically predict the helical flux to be at a relative 5PN order
> for quasi-circular non-precessing binaries. This prediction is
> compared with 113 quasi-circular non-precessing numerical relativity
> waveforms from the SXS catalog. We find good agreement between
> analytical and numerical results for quasi-circular non-precessing
> binaries establishing that helical symmetry starts to break at 5PN
> for these binaries.
