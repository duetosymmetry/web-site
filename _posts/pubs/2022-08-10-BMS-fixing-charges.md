> The Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, which uniquely
> describes the symmetries of asymptotic infinity and therefore of the
> gravitational waves that propagate there, has become increasingly
> important for accurate modeling of waveforms. In particular,
> waveform models, such as post-Newtonian (PN) expressions, numerical
> relativity (NR), and black hole perturbation theory, produce results
> that are in different BMS frames. Consequently, to build a model for
> the waveforms produced during the merging of compact objects, which
> ideally would be a hybridization of PN, NR, and black hole
> perturbation theory, one needs a fast and robust method for fixing
> the BMS freedoms. In this work, we present the first means of fixing
> the entire BMS freedom of NR waveforms to match the frame of either
> PN waveforms or black hole perturbation theory. We achieve this by
> finding the BMS transformations that change certain charges in a
> prescribed way — e.g., finding the center-of-mass transformation
> that maps the center-of-mass charge to a mean of zero. We find that
> this new method is 20 times faster, and more correct when mapping to
> the superrest frame, than previous methods that relied on
> optimization algorithms. Furthermore, in the course of developing
> this charge-based frame fixing method, we compute the PN expression
> for the Moreschi supermomentum to 3PN order without spins and 2PN
> order with spins. This Moreschi supermomentum is effectively
> equivalent to the energy flux or the null memory contribution at
> future null infinity ℐ⁺. From this PN calculation, we also compute
> oscillatory (m≠0 modes) and spin-dependent memory terms that have
> not been identified previously or have been missing from strain
> expressions in the post-Newtonian literature.
