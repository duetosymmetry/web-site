> We numerically investigate the imprints of gravitational
> radiation-reaction driven changes to a black hole's mass and spin on
> the corresponding ringdown waveform. We do so by comparing the
> dynamics of a perturbed black hole evolved with the full (nonlinear)
> versus linearized Einstein equations. As expected, we find that the
> quasinormal mode amplitudes extracted from nonlinear evolution
> deviate from their linear counterparts at third order in initial
> perturbation amplitude. For perturbations leading to a change in the
> black hole mass and spin of ∼5%, which is reasonable for a remnant
> formed in an astrophysical merger, we find that nonlinear
> distortions to the complex amplitudes of some quasinormal modes can
> be as large as ∼50% at the peak of the waveform. Furthermore, the
> change in the mass and spin results in a drift in the quasinormal
> mode frequencies, which for large amplitude perturbations causes the
> nonlinear waveform to rapidly dephase with respect to its linear
> counterpart. These two nonlinear effects together create a large
> distortion in both the amplitude and phase of the ringdown
> gravitational waveform. Surprisingly, despite these nonlinear
> effects creating significant deviations in the nonlinear waveform,
> we show that a linear quasinormal mode model still performs quite
> well from close to the peak amplitude onwards.
