> We present a numerical-relativity simulation of a black hole -
> neutron star merger in scalar-tensor (ST) gravity with binary
> parameters consistent with the gravitational wave event GW200115. In
> this exploratory simulation, we consider the Damour-Esposito-Farese
> extension to Brans-Dicke theory, and maximize the effect of
> spontaneous scalarization by choosing a soft equation of state and
> ST theory parameters at the edge of known constraints. We
> extrapolate the gravitational waves, including tensor and scalar
> (breathing) modes, to future null-infinity. The numerical waveforms
> undergo ~ 22 wave cycles before the merger, and are in good
> agreement with predictions from post-Newtonian theory during the
> inspiral. We find the ST system evolves faster than its
> general-relativity (GR) counterpart due to dipole radiation, merging
> a full gravitational-wave cycle before the GR counterpart. This
> enables easy differentiation between the ST waveforms and GR in the
> context of parameter estimation. However, we find that dipole
> radiation's effect may be partially degenerate with the NS tidal
> deformability during the late inspiral stage, and a full Bayesian
> analysis is necessary to fully understand the degeneracies between
> ST and binary parameters in GR.
