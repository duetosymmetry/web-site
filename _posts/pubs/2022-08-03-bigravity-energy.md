> One of the key ingredients for making binary waveform predictions in
> a beyond-GR theory of gravity is understanding the energy and
> angular momentum carried by gravitational waves and any other
> radiated fields. Identifying the appropriate energy functional is
> unclear in Hassan-Rosen bigravity, a ghost-free theory with one
> massive and one massless graviton. The difficulty arises from the
> new degrees of freedom and length scales which are not present in
> GR, rendering an Isaacson-style averaging calculation ambiguous. In
> this article we compute the energy carried by gravitational waves in
> bigravity starting from the action, using the canonical current
> formalism. The canonical current agrees with other common energy
> calculations in GR, and is unambiguous (modulo boundary terms),
> making it a convenient choice for quantifying the energy of
> gravitational waves in bigravity or any diffeomorphism-invariant
> theories of gravity. This calculation opens the door for future
> waveform modeling in bigravity to correctly include backreaction due
> to emission of gravitational waves.
