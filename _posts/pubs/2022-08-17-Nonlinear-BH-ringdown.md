> The gravitational wave strain emitted by a perturbed black hole (BH)
> ringing down is typically modeled analytically using first-order BH
> perturbation theory. In this Letter, we show that second-order
> effects are necessary for modeling ringdowns from BH merger
> simulations. Focusing on the strain's (ℓ,m)=(4,4) angular harmonic,
> we show the presence of a quadratic effect across a range of binary
> BH mass ratios that agrees with theoretical expectations. We find
> that the quadratic (4, 4) mode's amplitude exhibits quadratic
> scaling with the fundamental (2, 2) mode---its parent mode. The
> nonlinear mode's amplitude is comparable to or even larger than that
> of the linear (4, 4) mode. Therefore, correctly modeling the
> ringdown of higher harmonics---improving mode mismatches by up to 2
> orders of magnitude---requires the inclusion of nonlinear effects.
