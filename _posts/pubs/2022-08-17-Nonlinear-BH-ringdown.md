> The gravitational wave strain emitted by a perturbed black hole (BH)
> ringing down is typically modeled analytically using first-order BH
> perturbation theory. In this Letter we show that second-order
> effects are necessary for modeling ringdowns from BH merger
> simulations. Focusing on the strain's (â„“,m)=(4,4) angular harmonic,
> we show the presence of a quadratic effect across a range of binary
> BH mass ratios that agrees with theoretical expectations. We find
> that the quadratic (4,4) mode amplitude exhibits quadratic scaling
> with the fundamental (2,2) mode -- its parent mode. The nonlinear
> mode's amplitude is comparable to or even larger than that of the
> linear (4,4) modes. Therefore correctly modeling ringdown --
> improving mismatches by an order of magnitude -- requires the
> inclusion of nonlinear effects.
