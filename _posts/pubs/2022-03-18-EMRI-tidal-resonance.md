> One of the important targets for the future space-based
> gravitational wave observatory LISA is extreme mass ratio inspirals
> (EMRIs), where long and accurate waveform modeling is necessary for
> detection and characterization. Modeling EMRI dynamics requires
> accounting for effects such as the ones induced by an external tidal
> field, which can break integrability at resonances and cause
> significant dephasing. In this paper, we use a Newtonian analogue of
> a Kerr black hole to study the effect of an external tidal field on
> the dynamics and the gravitational waveform. We have developed a
> numerical framework that takes advantage of the integrability of the
> background system to evolve it with a symplectic splitting
> integrator, and compute approximate gravitational waveforms to
> estimate the timescale over which the perturbation affects the
> dynamics. Comparing this timescale with the characteristic time
> under radiation reaction at resonance, we introduce a tool for
> quantifying the regime in which tidal effects might be included when
> modeling EMRI gravitational waves. As an application of this
> framework, we perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics at one
> resonance to show how different entry points into the resonance in
> phase-space can produce substantially different dynamics, and how
> one can estimate bounds for the parameter space where tidal effects
> may become dominant. Such bounds will scale as $$\varepsilon \gtrsim
> C q$$, where $$\varepsilon$$ measures the strength of the external
> tidal field, $$q$$ is the mass ratio, and $$C$$ is a number which
> depends on the resonance and the shape of the tide. We demonstrate
> how to estimate C using our framework for the 2:3 radial to polar
> frequency resonance in our model system. This framework can serve as
> a proxy for proper modeling of the tidal perturbation in the fully
> relativistic case.
