> We revisit a textbook example of a singularly perturbed nonlinear
> boundary-value problem. Unexpectedly, it shows a wealth of phenomena
> that seem to have been overlooked previously, including a pitchfork
> bifurcation in the number of solutions as one varies the small
> parameter, and transcendentally small terms in the initial
> conditions that can be calculated by elementary means. Based on our
> own classroom experience, we believe this problem could provide an
> enjoyable workout for students in courses on perturbation methods,
> applied dynamical systems, or numerical analysis.
