> Highly precise and robust waveform models are required as
> improvements in detector sensitivity enable us to test general
> relativity with more precision than ever before. In this work, we
> introduce a spin-aligned surrogate ringdown model. This ringdown
> surrogate, NRSur3dq8_RD, is built with numerical waveforms produced
> using Cauchy-characteristic evolution. In addition, these waveforms
> are in the superrest frame of the remnant black hole allowing us to
> do a correct analysis of the ringdown spectrum. The novel prediction
> of our surrogate model is complex-valued quasinormal mode (QNM)
> amplitudes, with median relative errors of $$10^{-2}-10^{-3}$$ over the
> parameter space. Like previous remnant surrogates, we also predict
> the remnant black hole's mass and spin. The QNM mode amplitude
> errors translate into median errors on ringdown waveforms of
> $$10^{-4}$$. The high accuracy and QNM mode content provided by our
> surrogate will enable high-precision ringdown analyses such as tests
> of general relativity. Our ringdown model is publicly available
> through the python package surfinBH.
