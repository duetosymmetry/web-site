I am currently an Assistant Professor of
[Physics and Astronomy](http://physics.olemiss.edu/) at the
[University of Mississippi](http://www.olemiss.edu/).

Briefly, my research interests are studying and testing general
relativity and other theories of gravity from an astrophysical
standpoint.

I have investigated how “almost-general-relativity” theories can
affect gravitational observables.  An important observation which
would be able to distinguish between GR and almost-GR is the
gravitational waves from two merging black holes, as recently detected
by advanced LIGO.

Please see my [research]({{ site.url }}/research/) page for more
details of my research interests. You can also see my
[publications]({{ site.url }}/pubs/) page for a list of my relevant
publications and work in progress. For a summary, see my
[curriculum vitae]({{ site.url }}/LeoCStein.pdf).

About this site
===============

This site's name, *due to symmetry*, refers to one of the most
important theorems in mathematical physics:
[Noether's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem).
Noether's theorem says that every continuous symmetry of a physical
system generates a corresponding conserved quantity, and its
significance in modern physics can not be overstated.  This theorem
bears the name of
[Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether), who proved
and published this theorem at a time when women were not allowed to
teach in academia.  Not only did she shape modern physics and make
formative contributions to abstract algebra, she also broke through
the sexist barriers of her time.
